Integration of sentinel-hubs APIs within a basic gis application (plain js+html+css)

How to use:
cd to proxy-server and run npm install
run node proxy-server.js, the server will run in loaclhost:3000 by default

Proxy server is used to handle requests made to the sentinel-hub api

once the server is runing and listening, you can open index.html and see the app running
